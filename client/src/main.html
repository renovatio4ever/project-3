        <p class="lead">The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability convert a classic .NET utility dashboard to a full stack MERN (or MEAN) product. 
            The candidate dashboard was developed in .NET over 7 years leveraging and MVC approach. The framework is static, and applications (or "cards") were 
            added over time to extend the portals capabilities and scope of data presented. Each application took 3 to 6 month to develop as there were
            major challenges connecting and presenting multiple disperate sources at the same time. Moreover multiple versions of the portal was created
            to support PC, mobile, and smart devices.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">One of the major advantages of developing in MERN is the ability to incorporate out of the box webparts (i.e. JQuery, D3, Keen..etc) to display
            data and provide user interaction almost out of the box. In this project, a number of applications found in the candidate portal were emulated. 
            The result was the creation an extremely light weight WIP, and self contained version of the candidate portal that not only works
            natively in the browser but also across all smart and mobile devices.</p>

            <p class="lead">To put things in perspective the creation of this demo portal took approximately 1 weeks vs. the 8+ months it would have taken in the candidates
            portal development environment.</p>
